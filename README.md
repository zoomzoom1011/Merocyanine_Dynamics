# DA-type aggregate excitation transfer rate 

This code allows you to calculate DA type molecule absorption and pl properties by Essential State model pioneered by Anna Painelli in Parma University

Using time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation to simulate exciton dynamics in Essential State model and observe the coherence change and energy transfer rate over time.
