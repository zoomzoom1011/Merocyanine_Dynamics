# merocyanine_dynamics

This code allows you to calculate DA type molecule absorption and pl properties by Essential State model pioneered by Anna Painelli in Parma University

5.	Using time-independent Schr√∂dinger equation to simulate exciton dynamics in Essential State model and observe the coherence change over time.
